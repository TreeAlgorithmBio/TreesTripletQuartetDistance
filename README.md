# TreesTripletQuartetDistance

Phylogeny is the study of the evolutionary relationships between a set of organisms. Phylogenetic trees, are a graphical representation of these relationships.

We have partially implemented the algorithm for :

Brodal GS, et al ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)New
Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Philadelphia, USA: Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM); 2013. “ Efficient algorithms for computing the triplet and
quartet distance between trees of arbitrary degree ”; p. 1814-1832

Our codebase is highly inspired from :

Mailund and Christian N.S. Pedersen; “t qDist: A Library for Computing the
Quartet and Triplet Distances Between Binary or General Trees” ,
